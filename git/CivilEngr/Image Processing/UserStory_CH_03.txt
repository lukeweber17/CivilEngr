* Updated (3/23/2017): Requirement for specifying new image name was removed and the new name will assume the original name, but it will be saved in the "NewImage" folder.

As an administrator who wants to process images for the website, I want to be prompted to enter the general name of the input images and the unique image identifying number so that the code is reusable with no coding maintenance.
